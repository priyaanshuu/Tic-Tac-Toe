# Tic Tac Toe

This is *Tic Tac Toe* android app, developed by me in my first year of learning android development.This simple yet classic game allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of your symbols (X or O) on the grid.
